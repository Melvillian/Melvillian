### Melvillian Character ðŸ‘‹

Hey Earth!

I am a longtime builder in the crypto/blockchain/web3 software space. I have helped a build crypto unicorn (BitGo), designed smart contract coding curriculum for some quality educators (0xMacro), and a myriad of other technical (and I hope useful) things (Siren, and Lambda School).

I'm not on social media because I think it's net negative for my wellbeing, so the best way to contact to me is to know me in person, or make an issue here with info on how to contact you.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building web3 education tools/resources that allow me to help others and get paid
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create an Internet business, and how to build an AI assistant to help me do it
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything you're working on in web3 where you think I could be helpful
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment
